# CRM (Curses Rinky-Dink Manager)

CRM is a lightweight, terminal-based Client Relations Manager designed for simplicity and portability. Built using the `curses` library, CRM allows for quick and easy access to your client data, saved in a CSV format for straightforward manipulation outside the application.

The goal of CRM is to offer a slim and efficient solution for managing client relations, without the need for bloated software or complex database setups. Whether you're on a server, a laptop, or a minimal terminal environment, CRM is designed to work seamlessly.
